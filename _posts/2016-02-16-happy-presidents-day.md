description: "Presidents' Day is a time to stop and reflect on the dedication and achievements of the United State's past and present leaders. Overseeing the well-being of a nation is a task none but the President himself can imagine, and the pressures that come along with the duties no doubt create a deep-thirst only the bubbly goodness of beer can quench."
